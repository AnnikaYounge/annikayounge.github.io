**about me**

I'm a rising junior at Stanford in *B.S. Mathematical and Model Engineering*, with a secondary major in *Economics* and minor in *Philosophy*. I'm interested in causal inference, inequality, dynamics of belief, structured discovery, machine learning, social and economic networks, and model uncertainty.

I'm currently focused on research, art and reading groups, and humanitarian work. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads!

**featured projects**
* Causality in pediatric training and hospital systems strengthening in Liberia, Tigray, Jordan, and Gaza
* Arts and writing group (cartography, spatial analysis, time and imagination, epistemics of abstraction and design)
* Structured collaboration with AI for hypothesis generation and model discovery
* Adaptive decision-making for optimal health provision in emergency settings
* term paper: A Networks Perspective on Temporary Migration and Risk-Sharing
* term paper: Possible Worlds: Learning and Dynamics of Belief under Model Uncertainty
