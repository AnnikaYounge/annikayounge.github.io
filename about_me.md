## about me
Hi! I'm sophomore at Stanford studying **Data Science** and **Economics**. 

I'm interested in *signal and structure*: how do we derive meaning from limited or complex data? how do we approach unclear systems of interaction or causality? what consequence does broader structure have on individual behavior and decision-making? Some of my current interests include causal inference, inequality, social and economic networks, and theories of abstraction.

## in my free time
I love bird dogs, reading, travel, and being outdoors. see (current favorites!)[current_favs.md] for assorted thoughts and readings
