**about me**
Hi â€“ I'm Annika! I'm a sophomore at Stanford studying *Data Science* and *Economics*. Some of my current interests include causal inference, inequality, social and economic networks, spatial analysis, and theories of abstraction.

I'm interested in signal and structure: how do we derive meaning from limited or complex data? how do we approach unclear systems of interaction or causality? how does system structure affect patterns of behavior and decision-making? 

I draw on work from physics, the social sciences, statistics, philosophy, and machine learning, and I hope to use new quantitative methods to address social and economic issues.

**in my free time**
I love bird dogs, reading, travel, and being outdoors. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads! Current diversions include trying new cycling routes, trying to fix an old camera, getting back into classical piano, and visiting the rumsey map center.
