**about me**

I'm a rising junior at Stanford studying *Mathematical and Model Engineering* with a secondary major in *Economics* and a minor in *Philosophy*. I'm interested in causal inference, inequality, dynamics of belief, structured discovery, machine learning, social and economic networks, and model uncertainty. 

I'm currently focused on research, art and reading groups, and humanitarian work. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads!

**featured projects**
* robust experimental design and adaptive methods with high-dimensional partition sets
* causality of pediatric training and hospital systems strengthening in Liberia, Tigray, Jordan, and Gaza
* arts and writing group (spatial organization, time and imagination, cartography, epistemics of abstraction and design)
* dynamics of belief and information: skepticism, persuasion, and optimal information disclosure
* structured collaboration with AI for hypothesis generation and model discovery
* adaptive decision-making for optimal health provision in emergency settings
* labor mobility and a networks perspective on temporary migration and risk-sharing
