**about me**

I'm a rising junior at Stanford in *B.S. Mathematical and Model Engineering* and secondary major *B.S. Economics*. I'm interested in causal inference, inequality, dynamics of belief, machine learning, social and economic networks, and model uncertainty.

I'm currently focused on research, reading groups, and humanitarian and global health work. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads!

**featured projects**
* Learning and dynamics of belief under model uncertainty
* Causality in pediatric training and hospital systems strengthening
* Reading group (cartography, spatial analysis, time and imagination, epistemics of abstraction and design)
* Skepticism in social learning and implications for political polarization, inequality, and persuasion
* A networks perspective on temporary migration and risk-sharing
* Structured collaboration with AI for hypothesis generation and model discovery
