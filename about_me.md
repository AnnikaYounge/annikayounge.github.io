# about me
Hi! I'm sophomore at Stanford pursuing a B.S. in **Data Science** and **Economics**. 

I'm interested in **signal and structure**
> how do we derive meaning from limited or complex data? how do we approach unclear systems of interaction or causality? what consequence does broader structure have on individual behavior and decision-making?

My current interests include causal inference, inequality, social and economic networks, and theories of abstraction. Ultimately, I hope to find clear quantitative improvements to the models and methods that we use to approach real-world economic and social issues.

#### in my free time
I love bird dogs, reading, travel, and being outdoors.
