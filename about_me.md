## about me
Hi! I'm sophomore at Stanford studying **Data Science** and **Economics**. 

I'm interested in *signal and structure*: 
  how do we derive meaning from limited or complex data? how do we approach unclear systems of interaction or causality? what consequence does broader structure have on individual behavior and decision-making? 
Some of my current interests include causal inference, inequality, social and economic networks, spatial analysis, and theories of abstraction.

## in my free time
I love bird dogs, reading, travel, and being outdoors. see [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads! current diversions include spending time at the rumsey map center with cartographically-inclined friends, looking for new cycling routes, getting back into classical piano, and tinkering with an old film camera.
