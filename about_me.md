**about me**
Hi â€“ I'm Annika! I'm a sophomore at Stanford studying *Data Science* and *Economics*. Some of my current interests include causal inference, inequality, social and economic networks, spatial analysis, and theories of abstraction. I draw on work from statistics, economics, physics, philosophy, and machine learning, and I hope to use new quantitative methods to address social and economic issues.

**in my free time**
I love bird dogs, reading, travel, and being outdoors. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads! Current diversions include trying new cycling routes, getting back into piano, and visiting the rumsey map center.
