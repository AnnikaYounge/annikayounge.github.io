**about me**
Hi! I'm a sophomore at Stanford studying **Data Science** and **Economics**. 

I'm interested in signal and structure: how do we derive meaning from limited or complex data? how do we approach unclear systems of interaction or causality? how does system structure affect patterns of behavior and decision-making?

Some of my current interests include causal inference, inequality, social and economic networks, spatial analysis, and theories of abstraction.

**in my free time**
I love bird dogs, reading, travel, and being outdoors. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads! Current diversions include trying new cycling routes, trying to fix an old camera, getting back into classical piano, and visiting the rumsey map center.
