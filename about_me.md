**about me**
Hi â€“ I'm Annika! I'm a sophomore at Stanford studying *Mathematical and Model Engineering*. I'm interested in causal inference, inequality, dynamics of information, machine learning, social and economic networks, model discovery, and model uncertainty. I plan to work on evidence-based approaches to human welfare and well-being.

**in my free time**
I love being outdoors, reading, traveling, joining talks on campus, and hiking with my dogs. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads! Recent diversions include trying new cycling routes, getting back into piano, and writing letters to friends.
