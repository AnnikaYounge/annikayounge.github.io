**about me**

I'm a rising junior at Stanford in *B.S. Mathematical and Model Engineering*. I'm interested in causal inference, inequality, dynamics of belief, machine learning, social and economic networks, and model uncertainty.

I'm currently focused on research, art and reading groups, and humanitarian work. See [current_favs](current_favs.md) for assorted thoughts and reads!

**featured projects**
* Causality in pediatric training and hospital systems strengthening
* Arts and writing group (cartography, time and imagination, epistemics of abstraction and design)
* Structured collaboration for hypothesis generation and model discovery
* Adaptive decision-making for optimal health provision in emergency settings
* term paper: A Networks Perspective on Temporary Migration and Risk-Sharing
* term paper: Possible Worlds: Learning and Dynamics of Belief under Model Uncertainty
