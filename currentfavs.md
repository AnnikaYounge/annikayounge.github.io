# latest reads
1. **Underworld** by Don Delillo (– longer than some of his other works, but just as eclectic and postmodern. i love don delillo.)
2. **Demon Copperhead** by Barbara Kingsolver
3. **Shantaram** by Gregory David Roberts
4. **Angle of Repose** by Wallace Stegner (- my new favorite pulitzer prize winner, albeit after confederacy of dunces and shipping news. makes me want to go back to the forest service or at least back to colorado)
5. **Waiting for Godot** by Samuel Beckett (– not a thing happens.)
6. **Narcissus and Goldmund** by Hermann Hesse (– set in medieval and religious contexts, but still felt weirdly pertinent and personal)
