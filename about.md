# About me
Hi! I am a sophomore at Stanford studying Data Science and Economics. 

My current interests include causal inference, inequality, social and economic networks, and theories of abstraction.

Broadly, I am interested in **signal and structure**:

- how do we derive meaning from limited or complex data?
- how do we approach unclear systems of interaction or causality?
- what consequence does broader structure have on individual behavior and decision-making? 

My coursework draws on information theory, economics, machine learning, statistical inference, philosophy, and the social sciences at large.
