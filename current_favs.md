## recent favorites (as of 2025.11)
1. **Flatland** by Edwin A. Abbott
2. **The Glass Bead Game** by Hermann Hesse *(such a subtle, profound, and compassionate book - I imagine Hesse writing it slowly and with a twinkle in his eye. of course my (unapologetic!) main reaction was to be very seriously moved by its treatment of learning and purpose. an incredible read)*
3. **Gitanjali** by Rabindranath Tagore
4. **Galatea 2.2** by Richard Powers *(I've only read his 90s work, so I get to be bitter and pretentious about his deserved popularity post-Overstory))*
5. **In a Grove** by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa *(onboarding for rashomon)*
