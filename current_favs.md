## current diversions
spending time at the rumsey map center with cartographically-inclined friends, looking for new cycling routes, getting back into classical piano, planning for a course in mexico city this summer

## recent reads
as of march 2025
1. **Underworld** by Don Delillo *– longer than some of his other works, but just as eclectic and postmodern. i love don delillo.*
2. **Demon Copperhead** by Barbara Kingsolver
3. **Shantaram** by Gregory David Roberts
4. **Angle of Repose** by Wallace Stegner *– my new favorite pulitzer prize winner, albeit after confederacy of dunces and shipping news. makes me want to go back to the forest service or at least back to colorado*
5. **Waiting for Godot** by Samuel Beckett *– not a thing happens.*
6. **Narcissus and Goldmund** by Hermann Hesse *– set in medieval and religious contexts, but still felt very viscerally real and personally relevant*
