1. **Shantaram** by Gregory David Roberts
2. **Waiting for Godot** by Samuel Beckett *(– nothing happens.)*
3. **Underworld** by Don Delillo *(– longer than some of his other works, but just as eclectic and postmodern. i love don delillo.)*
4. **Narcissus and Goldmund** by Hermann Hesse *(beautiful and personal. felt almost shockingly timeless and relevant for a narrative set in older medieval and religious settings)*
5. **Demon Copperhead** by Barbara Kingsolver
6. **The Days Are Just Packed: Calvin and Hobbes #8** by Bill Watterson *(- had an undue influence on my childhood and i'm glad it did, i absolutely love these collections)*
7. **Angle of Repose** by Wallace Stegner *(– my favorite pulitzer prize winning book after confederacy of dunces and shipping news. makes me want to go back to the forest service or at least back to colorado)*
